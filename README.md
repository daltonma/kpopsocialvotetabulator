# K-Pop Social Voting Tabulator

This is a script to process ballots for song collection. 

Ballots should be a csv file called `ballots.csv` and should contain the following structure:

```csv
Choice 1, Choice 2, Choice 3
```


`choices.list` should be a file containing a list of valid choices, where each line is a string containing a distinct choice.

example:
```
Bite Me - ENHYPEN
LALALALA - Stray Kids
Halazia - ATEEZ
Bite Me - ENHYPEN
Maniac - Stray Kids
Oh Mymy : 7s - TWS
Given-Taken - ENHYPEN
```

**This repo STANs ENHYPEN**
